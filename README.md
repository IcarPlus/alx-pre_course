My first readme
This is my Second README since starting my SE journey with ALX, 
The project i am currently working on are part of a series of test provided to get familiar with the Linux environment, git and github
I learned how to create a file, edit it and move it to a new directory
I learned about creating a directory, adding files, renaming it and deleting it when it is empty and when is it non-empty
I learned the basics of adding, committing and pushing changes to git and it's best practices and why it is important
I learned how to work on project with a thought in mind that a collegue might review or add on my work, hence the importance of commit messages
On to the next task!! : )
